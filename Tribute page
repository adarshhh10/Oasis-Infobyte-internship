                    <h2>If you ever heard a random yell of  “cool” at least 12 to 15 times as against once like normal people, or you find your friend singing “I want it that way” by Backstreet Boys at the top of their lungs but with a twist. Worry not! They are all Brooklyn Nine-Niners!

                        This cop comedy unlike any other comedy on TV is set in the 99th precinct of NYPD in Brooklyn and covers the crazy adventures that the team of detectives get into on a daily basis. This precinct is headed by an openly gay black cop, Captain Raymond Holt played by Andre Braugher who has a stone cold exterior and feels that a smile for more than 5 seconds is a conman’s ruse. Playing his favourite detective and the biggest pain in the ass is the ex-SNL star comedian Andy Samberg. His character Jake Peralta is the life of the precinct due to his goofy and fun loving nature. However he is very passionate about his job as a detective and he loves solving mysteries and he loves movies, Die Hard, in particular. Making up the rest of the team is Terry Crews, who plays Sergeant Terry Jeffords, a big muscular black man who is a super softie and loves yoghurt, his family and love. (Terry loves love!)</p>

    <h2>
        Jake is a very competent detective with an incredibly immature, yet charming personality. He often butts heads with authority and teases his partner, and later wife, Amy Santiago. He has trouble expressing his emotions, preferring to crack jokes and deflect with humor, but he usually comes around to talking about how he's feeling. He is extremely intelligent and calculating, yet his wits are most often channeled into coming up with clever wordplay instead of more detail-oriented work.
        He is a very laid-back individual, but he takes his job seriously and likes the arresting-bad-guys part the most. Jake clashes with Captain Holt because of the latter's practical, down-to-earth methods against Jake's wisecracking nature. Jake Peralta has abandonment issues, given that his father left him at an extremely young age. He is also a big fan of the movie Die Hard, always being excited when he is able or has an opportunity to act out a Die Hard scene during police work.
        .At Captain Holt's request, Jake has taken to sometimes wearing a tie. He used to wear a watch on his left wrist in the earlier episodes, his police badge on a chain around his neck and starting from the Season 5 Finale, a wedding ring on his left finger.As a child, Jake was the shortstop on his little league team. His dad was the coach, and after every game would take the team to Sal's Pizza. Halfway through their last season, Roger Peralta left his wife and son.Jake attended the same elementary and high school as Gina Linetti. As children, the two would hang out at Jake's Nana's apartment after school.

        <h1>Jake and Amy :  </h1>
        <p>
    <h2>
        Though Jake and Amy are partners, they have a very competitive relationship. They often try to one-up each other or participate in bets. Though they argue and tease each other, it is clear they have mutual respect, and share a close friendship.
As the series progresses, their friendship develops into a romantic interest. As of season 3 episode 1; "New Captain", they are officially dating.
Jake says he figured out he wanted to marry Amy on April 28th, 2017, while they were in bed, and Amy pointed out that there was a typo in her crossword puzzle.
They seem like polar opposites with Amy being a neat freak and a bit detail-oriented, while Jake is more childish in his antics. However, their love proved to be heartwarming and realistic, and their opposite personalities were perfect for one another.   
The reason Jake and Amy’s competition with one another never crosses lines or breaks either of them is because at their core, they both believe and admire one another’s skills. They cannot have the same energy with anyone else because they both have such different means of operating that the best outcomes result in fortifying the belief that’s within them.
From enemies to unrequited love to friends, to best friends and then to a family. Jake and Amy are each other’s home, and Charles rooting for them as much is just an accurate representation of all us. We are Charles Boyle. Charles Boyle is us. Sometimes, there just aren’t enough words for them.

    <h2>Inside every broken adult is a kid who wasn’t loved enough, and that becomes one of the more evident traits we are nudged to look closer to when it comes to Jake Peralta. Because of his father’s abandonment, he harbors intense fears that every single person at some point will abandon him. And so, he deflects with humor. He pretends like he has it all together. He pretends like all he cares about is the competition when really, it’s all about the human interaction.

        Yes, Jake is intensely competitive, but why? When looking closely, we can see that it’s because if he wins, maybe, just maybe people will stay. People won’t leave. So much of his humor and essentially mocking himself and his issues are his means of coping in such a way where the lost boy isn’t seen by others. But when Jake begins to fall in love and when cases grow in intensity—his vulnerability comes through in the form of a man who’s just wanting to be taken care of.
        
        The “cool cool cool cool cool” was always his means of convincing himself that everything is going to be okay, and that’s a large reason why he’s so memorable as a character. Jake could have been nothing more than a jokester with a heart, but Jake Peralta is as relatable as it gets because the fears inside of him are a reflection of what so many of us have felt too. It’s easy to mutter “cool” a thousand times until we convince ourselves everything is fine.
        
        But the solution isn’t to bottle things up, it’s to deal with the issue head on. And Jake’s vulnerability as a man is shown in his means of trying to understand how to navigate through hurdles in the world in such a way where he’s a better companion to others than he has seen. Thereby, this approach is further proof of the detail that deep down, he’s just a kid wanting love more than anything. He doesn’t want people to experience the kind of fears he has lived through.
        
        He is a man where it matters, but throughout Brooklyn Nine-Nine’s run, oftentimes he was just a boy searching for guidance. And when he is finally given the recognition that he deserves and the love that he’s always wanted from his family through the team, he uses it to pass it on to others.
        
        As much Jake could be a nuisance, at his core (and often overtly) he has wanted to be liked and respected. Which, really—can we blame him? Isn’t that something everyone wants at the end of the day? It’s natural, and I’ve always appreciated the way Brooklyn Nine-Nine showed that with an almost childlike innocence through his character. He’s very cool but simultaneously so uncool. He appears to care a normal amount when really, he cares tremendously.
